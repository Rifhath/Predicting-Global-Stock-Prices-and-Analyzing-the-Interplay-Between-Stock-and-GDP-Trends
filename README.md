# Predicting-Global-Stock-Prices-and-Analyzing-the-Interplay-Between-Stock-and-GDP-Trends

**Overview**

This project explores the complex relationship between global stock prices and GDP trends, aiming to provide actionable insights for investors and policymakers. The analysis includes data processing, visualization, and predictive modeling using machine learning techniques such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and ensemble algorithms like Gradient Boosting. By leveraging these techniques, the study identifies patterns in financial data and evaluates how stock market fluctuations impact GDP.

**Key Objectives**

Understand the historical trends and patterns in global stock prices and GDP.
Forecast stock prices using advanced time-series analysis methods.
Compare the financial shifts and their impact on GDP across different countries.
Provide insights into economic dynamics for better investment strategies.

**Key Features**

**Data Sources:** Stock data from Yahoo Finance and GDP per capita data from global organizations like the World Bank and IMF.
**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, merged datasets, and converted stock prices to USD for standardization.
**Feature Selection:** Utilized techniques like Gradient Boosting to identify key drivers of stock price trends.
**Time-Series Forecasting:** Implemented FFT to predict stock prices based on historical data.
**Visualization:** Generated intuitive graphs to compare stock trends, GDP patterns, and their interrelations over time.

**Technologies Used**

**Programming Language:** Python

**Libraries:**

**Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
**Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, Gradient Boosting
**Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
**Time-Series Analysis:** DARTS, FFT
**Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

**CSV Files**

The repository includes processed datasets:

**Stock_Data.csv:** Contains cleaned stock market data with columns for region, exchange, and adjusted closing prices in USD.
**GDP_Data.csv:** Provides GDP per capita for multiple countries, serving as a basis for economic analysis.

**Results**

Gradient Boosting achieved the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) in predicting stock prices.
FFT effectively identified dominant patterns in stock price fluctuations.
Visual analysis revealed how the COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant drop in both stock prices and GDP in 2020.

**Future Enhancements**

Incorporate deep learning models like LSTMs for time-series forecasting.
Expand the dataset to include multi-industry stock trends.
Enhance GDP analysis with additional socio-economic indicators.
